**Installation**:
You should read the tutorial on developerworks [url tbd]. This repository lets you access the entire sources code.

The code is split in three parts:
- Under the directory `IoT Starter Mobile App`, you will find the binary packages for both Mobile Operating System supported by the Dw Article. 
	- One subfolder called 'Android Version' containing the APK 'iot-starter-for-android.apk' for the IoT Starter Mobile Application Android Version
	- One subfolder called 'iOS Version' containing the IPA 'IoTstarter.ipa' for the IoT Starter Mobile Application iOS Version
- Under the directory `flows`, you will find the flows for Node-RED. Each flow is considered to put on a separate tab.
